Thank you to everyone that helped me. I finally finished my game. It's my first time trying to develop a game and using Java. It's really fun trying to think what to do in the game. I learned a lot of things, mainly in the concept of object oriented programming. Since it's my first time trying java and using OOP it made me understand the concept quicker. I am looking forward to the future of possible things and games I can do.
